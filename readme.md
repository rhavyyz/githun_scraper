# GitHub Scraper

This is meant to be a scraper that take information from a github profile and is connected 
with a flask api to send information to a portifolio creator

This is not meant to be just a copy of a github profile in a portifolio. The ideia is to 
use some anotations on repository description to group repositories of some specific topic
or to ignore it.
